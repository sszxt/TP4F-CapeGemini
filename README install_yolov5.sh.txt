I've created a bash script for you that installs all the necessary packages for YOLOv5. You can download it using the link below

[Download install_yolov5.sh](sandboxmntdatainstall_yolov5.sh)

### Instructions to Use
1. Download the script to your desired location.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable (if necessary) using the command

   ```bash

   chmod +x install_yolov5.sh

   ```
4. Run the script by executing

   ```bash

   .install_yolov5.sh

   ```

This will create a virtual environment and install all required packages. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
